## Documentation

Refer to the [Developer Guide](./docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md) to get an idea how the app was structured, and how to build and package the app.

## Contributing

All work done on the Chartr app happens directly on [GitHub](https://github.com/AerovekCommunity/Chartr.Android). Both core team members and external contributors send pull requests which go through the same review process.

If you are interested in contributing directly to the code base, the first thing you should do is read our [Litepaper](https://github.com/AerovekCommunity/litepaper) to get an understanding of what Chartr is and how it's supposed to work. 

Then in the AeroDAO Telegram channel ask to be added as a contributor and provide the email associated with your github account.

## Downloading the beta version
The beta version is useful in case you are not a developer and would like to contribute by playing with the app and proposing new features or reporting bugs that you find. 
Keep in mind that it is not going to be the latest version. If you'd like to request a new beta build, please create a issue ticket for that.

If you'd like to have access to the beta version please follow these steps

- Request access by [creating a new issue](https://github.com/AerovekCommunity/Chartr.Android/issues/new)
- Title it "Requesting beta access"
- In the comment section add your Gmail address that you use to access the Google Play store on your phone
- You will then get an email with a link to sign up for the beta program. *IMPORTANT* Open this link from your phone and make sure you are signed into the same account you provided in the issue
- Follow the instructions to download the app from the store. It will say (Internal Beta) next to the app name


## **Submitting Code Changes**
1. Clone the repo
```
git clone https://github.com/AerovekCommunity/Chartr.Android.git
```
2. Create an issue describing the bugfix or feature you plan to work on. Here's one that has been created already - [Implement Transaction Details](https://github.com/AerovekCommunity/Chartr.Android/issues/1), or if one exists already that you want to work on just assign yourself to it.
3. Create a branch off of `main` and name it something that describes the issue. First make sure your main branch is up to date
    ```
    git checkout main
    git pull
    git checkout -b implement-transaction-details
    ```
4. Do the work in that branch and commit and push to remote when ready
    ```
    git add . 
    git commit -m "your commit notes"
    git push origin implement-transaction-details
    ```
5. Create a pull request from your branch into main and ask a core contributor to review it
6. Once the pull request is approved you can merge your branch into main
