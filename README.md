## Documentation

Refer to the [Developer Guide](./docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md) to get an idea how the app was structured, and how to build and package the app.

## Contributing

All work done on the Chartr app happens directly on [GitHub](https://github.com/AerovekCommunity/Chartr.Android). Both core team members and external contributors send pull requests which go through the same review process.

If you are interested in contributing directly to the code base, the first thing you should do is read our [Litepaper](./docs/LITEPAPER.md) to get an understanding of what Chartr is and how it's supposed to work. 

You can also join our Telegram and Discord channels and ask questions there.
